On August 20, 2013 I collected a round of data based on a sample of random 
numbers generated on July 20, 2013.

On November 20, 2013, I collected a follow up round of data plus some 
additional data points.

On February 20, 2014, I collected an additional round of data and added some 
additional data points.

On May 20, 2014, I collected what I thought would be the final round of data. 
However, after exploring the data I decided that a better picture of the growth 
of this journal's first year would require one more round of data in order to 
have four intervals to examine, or a full year's worth of changes.

What I'll likely do is continue collecting data on this sample in order to have
a long run view of the changes.

Today, on August 20, 2014, I collected the fifth round of data. No additional
data points were added.

Currently, the data is stored in a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet file and is
exported to a CSV file for analysis with R using R Studio.

The variables are the same as that which is listed in the entry on May 20, 
\2014. That entry has been updated over the last few months. See that post for 
a description of each variable. I'll add descriptive quantitative information 
in a new post shortly.
